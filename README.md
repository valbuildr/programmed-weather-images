# programmed-weather-images

A simple Discord bot that generates an image with the current conditions in a certain city.

Supports imperial and metric units.

The public bot is currently in a closed beta until the code is more refined and tested. If you'd like to host the bot yourself, read [HOSTING.md](./HOSTING.md)
